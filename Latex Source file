 \section*{Introduction:}
 Pokemon is one of the most OG game in gameboy.
 In the game user is provided with a single pokemon which he uses throughout the game to acquire more 
 pokemons and defeat gym trainers. However in our game we are gonna provide the user with a list of 
 pokemons from which the user can choose 3 pokemons. Then we will skip to the fight with the gym trainer.
 There will be three 1v1 fights and the player with the last pokemon standing wins.

\section*{Game features:}
A bunch of pokemons will be provided with each pokemon having four abilities which varies among them.
The user can pick three pokemons. And a random three pokemons from the pokemon list will be assigned 
to the gym trainer in our case the computer. The user will be the first one to use an ability or start the 
battle. 

 \section*{Algorithm:}
The user uses an ability which either damages the trainers pokemon or suppress one of it's abilities.
Then its the trainers turn to use it's pokemon's ability. When the first pokemon of the user or the trainer 
faints, then the second Pokemon is sent to battle. This continues until all the Pokemons of a player faints then the other player wins the battle.
\newpage
\section*{UI:}
The UI will first show the List of Pokemons available from where the user will
select three. The user can select three of the same kind if he wants to. Then the
UI will show 3 Pokemons name with their images and the user will click on one to 
send it to battle. Then the UI will show 4 buttons with ability name. Clicking on 
a button will execute that ability and proper images/info will be shown if it's a
hit or a miss. When a Pokemon of the user faints he will be shown two more Pokemons 
to choose for battle. This continues till there is a winner.
